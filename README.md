# Graph Builder 2
Program for building mathematical graphs and visualizing algorithms.

## Features
### Main features

* Build graphs (**oriented** or **not oriented**)
* **Save** them to file
* **Load plugins with graph agorithms** with step-by-step animation
* **Write your own algorithm** and load it as plugin

### Algorithms

* Breadth-first search (BFS)
* Depth-first search (DFS)
* Dijkstra
* Bridges
* Minimum spanning tree (Prim)
* Minimum spanning tree (Kruskal)

**To write your own algorithm plugin see wiki.**
